### Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks


* Task 1 - Prediction Using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
  - This is the simple Linear Regression task as it involve just 2 variables.
  - Tool  Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data
  - Problem Statement : What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
  - Here is the solution : https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6757317864069369856/



* Task 2 - Prediction Using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
*  - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
  - This is the simple Linear Regression task as it involve just 2 variables.


#Task 6 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
