### Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks


* Task 1 - Prediction Using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

             - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

             - This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.




#Task 2 - Prediction Using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.


#Task 6 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
