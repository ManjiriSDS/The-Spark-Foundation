## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks



* #### Prediction Using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  - Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.
  - This is the simple Linear Regression task as it involve just 2 variables.
  - Tool  Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data
  - Problem Statement : What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
  - Here is the solution : 
  - Code : https://github.com/ManjiriSDS/The-Spark-Foundation/blob/main/Task%201%20The%20Sparks%20Foundation.ipynb 
  - Recorded Output in a Video : 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* #### Prediction Using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  - From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimal number of clusters and represent it visually.
  - Tool Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
  - Here is the solution :
  - Code : https://github.com/ManjiriSDS/The-Spark-Foundation/blob/main/Task%202%20The%20Sparks%20Foundation.ipynb
  - Recorded Output in a Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk7fWt_TNcs&t=2s
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* #### Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
  - Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
  - Tool Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
  - Problem Statement : If we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
  - Here is the solution : 
  - Code : https://github.com/ManjiriSDS/The-Spark-Foundation/blob/main/Task%206%20The%20Sparks%20Foundation.ipynb
  - Recorded Output in a Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubZ2saIFQj0&t=5s

* #### Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)
  - Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’.
  - Tool Used Tableau Software
  - Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b
  - Problem Statement : As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team. 
                        Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
  - Here is the solution :
