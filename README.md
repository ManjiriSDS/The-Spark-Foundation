## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks



* #### Task 1 - Prediction Using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
  - This is the simple Linear Regression task as it involve just 2 variables.
  - Tool  Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data
  - Problem Statement : What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
  - Here is the solution :
