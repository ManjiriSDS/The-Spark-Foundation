## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks



* #### Prediction Using Supervised ML 
  - Tool  Used Python Jupyter Notebook
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data
  - Problem Statement : What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
  - Here is the solution : 
  - Code : https://github.com/ManjiriSDS/The-Spark-Foundation/blob/main/Task%201%20The%20Sparks%20Foundation.ipynb 
  - Recorded Output in a Video :

| Sr No. | Project | Description | Problem Statement | Status |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| | **BEGINNER** |
| 1 | Prediction Using Supervised ML | <ul><li> Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours. </li> <li> This is the simple Linear Regression task as it involve just 2 variables. </li> | What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? | &#9745; |
| 2 | Prediction Using Unsupervised ML | <ul><li> Iris Dataset </li> | From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimal number of clusters and represent it visually. |&#9745; |
| | **INTERMEDIATE** | 
| 3 | Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm | <ul><li> Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. </li> | If we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. | &#9745; |
| | **ADVANCED** | 
| 4 | Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports | <ul><li> Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’. </li> |  As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.| &#9745; |
